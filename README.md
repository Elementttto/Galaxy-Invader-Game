# Galaxy-Invader-Game

To play the game, you need to download all the files and run the Run_Game.py file while having other files in the same directory.

To add your own image, you can replace the Alienship.bmp file with your custom image(get creative!) and to add your custom sound, replace Laser_sound.wav file.

Adjust difficulty settings from settings.py to your own level.

And finally, happy shooting.
